This is my senior project.
Topic title: Building a fanpage-styled application for food and beverage providers.

Summary: 
  The aim of this project was to create an application which supports food and beverage providers
sale online on the facebook messenger platform.The food and beverage providers use a mobile application 
to create menus, promotions, answers of frequently asked questions which users access on the provider fanpage inbox. 
Through the provider fanpage inbox, users can choose some foods or drinks to request a delivery
or get answers of some frequently asked questions without supporting from humans.
